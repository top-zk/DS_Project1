    "症状描述": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a swelling in the aorta, the artery that carries blood from the heart to the tummy (abdomen). Most aneurysms do not cause any problems, but they can be serious because there's a risk they could burst (rupture). Symptoms of abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal aortic aneurysm often has no symptoms. You usually only find out you have one during an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening test or during tests for another condition. If an aneurysm gets bigger, you might sometimes notice: tummy or back pain a pulsing feeling in your tummy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have tummy or back pain that does not go away or keeps coming back you feel a lump in your tummy These symptoms can be caused by lots of things and do not mean you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, but it's best to get them checked. Immediate action required: Call 999 if you or someone else: have sudden, severe pain in your tummy or back are struggling to breathe or have stopped breathing have pale or grey skin (on brown or black skin this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet) lose consciousness These could be signs of an abdominal aortic aneurysm bursting (rupturing). This is a life-threatening emergency that needs to be treated in hospital as soon as possible. Tests for abdominal aortic aneurysm The main test to find out if you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm is an ultrasound scan of your tummy. A small device is placed on your tummy and images of the inside of your tummy will be shown on a screen. You'll usually be told if you have an aneurysm at the end of the test. You’ll also be told how big it is: small (3cm to 4.4cm or smaller) medium (4.5cm to 5.4cm) large (5.5cm or bigger) Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm An ultrasound test is offered to all men when they turn 65, as they're most at risk of getting an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is called abdominal aortic aneurysm screening . Treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm Treatment for an abdominal aortic aneurysm usually depends on how big it is and if you have symptoms. If it's small, lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and eating healthily may be recommended to help stop it getting bigger. Sometimes you may need: medicines to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol level, which may help stop the aneurysm getting bigger surgery to reduce the risk of the aneurysm bursting - this may be done if your AAA is large (5.5cm or bigger), is quickly getting bigger or is painful Surgery has risks and side effects which your doctor or surgeon should discuss with you. Abdominal aortic aneurysms often get bigger over time. You'll usually need regular scans to see if it's getting bigger. If your aneurysm ruptures, you’ll need emergency surgery to treat it. How to lower your risk of getting an abdominal aortic aneurysm Making healthy lifestyle changes can help lower your risk of getting an abdominal aortic aneurysm, or stop one from getting bigger. Do eat healthily exercise regularly try to lose weight if you're overweight try to cut down on alcohol Don’t do not smoke Information: Find out how to get help to quit smoking Causes of an abdominal aortic aneurysm An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens when the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the tummy (the aorta) becomes weakened. It's not always clear what causes it, but some people have a higher chance of getting one. You’re more at risk if you: are male and aged 65 or over smoke or used to smoke have high blood pressure have high cholesterol have a close relative who's had an abdominal aortic aneurysm have coronary or peripheral artery disease ( atherosclerosis ) have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a condition such as Marfan syndrome Sometimes an abdominal aortic aneurysm can be caused by an infection, but this is rare.

Credit: ANDRE LABBE, ISM/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/886025/view The patches often appear gradually without any other symptoms. Sometimes the skin may be itchy. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have new dark patches on your skin you have any skin changes you're unsure about What happens at your appointment A GP can usually tell if it's acanthosis nigricans by looking at your skin. Although acanthosis nigricans is usually harmless, it's best to get any skin changes checked out. Rarely, it can be a sign of something more serious, such as cancer. You may need some tests to find out what's causing the patches. Causes of acanthosis nigricans The most common cause of acanthosis nigricans is obesity . Other causes include: type 2 diabetes conditions that affect hormone levels – such as Cushing's syndrome , polycystic ovary syndrome or an underactive thyroid taking certain medicines – including steroids or hormone treatments like the contraceptive pill rarely, cancer – usually stomach cancer rarely, a faulty gene inherited from your parents Sometimes healthy people with no other conditions get acanthosis nigricans. This is more common in people with black or brown skin. Treating acanthosis nigricans Once a GP knows what's causing acanthosis nigricans, they can recommend the best treatment. The patches should fade over time once the cause is treated. If you're very overweight, a GP may recommend losing weight. Depending on the cause, they may also recommend: medicine to balance your hormones medicine to balance your insulin levels changing your medicine to one that does not cause the patches There's no specific treatment for the patches themselves. A skin specialist (dermatologist) may be able to suggest treatments to improve their appearance, but finding and treating the cause is usually recommended first.

    ],
    "症状描述": "Achalasia is a rare disorder of the food pipe (oesophagus), which can make it difficult to swallow food and drink. Normally, the muscles of the oesophagus contract to squeeze food along towards the stomach. A ring of muscle at the end of the food pipe then relaxes to let food into the stomach. In achalasia, the muscles in the oesophagus do not contract correctly and the ring of muscle can fail to open properly, or does not open at all. Food and drink cannot pass into the stomach and becomes stuck. It is often brought back up. Symptoms of achalasia Not everyone with achalasia will have symptoms. But most people with achalasia will find it difficult to swallow food or drink (known as dysphagia ). Swallowing tends to get gradually more difficult or painful over a couple of years, to the point where it is sometimes impossible. Other symptoms include: bringing back up undigested food choking and coughing fits heartburn chest pain repeated chest infections drooling of vomit or saliva gradual but significant weight loss Symptoms of achalasia may start at any time of life. Swallowing problems can also be caused by cancers of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. There’s a link between long-term achalasia and the risk of developing cancer of the oesophagus , but the risk is small. It’s always important to get symptoms checked straight away, even if your symptoms are not bothering you. Causes of achalasia Achalasia is thought to happen when the nerves in the oesophagus become damaged and stop working properly, which is why the muscles and ring of muscle do not work. The exact cause of this is unknown. In some people, it may be linked to a viral infection. It may also be associated with having an autoimmune condition, where the body's immune system attacks healthy cells, tissue and organs. In rare cases, it's possible that achalasia is caused by a faulty gene. Diagnosing achalasia If a GP thinks you have achalasia, you'll be referred to hospital to have some diagnostic tests. Achalasia may also be diagnosed during an investigation, such as a chest X-ray , for another reason. The tests for achalasia include: manometry – a small plastic tube is passed through your mouth or nose into your oesophagus to measure the muscle pressure along it at different points. barium swallow – you drink a white liquid containing the chemical barium and X-rays are taken. The barium shows up clearly on X-ray so the doctor can see how long it takes to move into your stomach. endoscopy – a thin, flexible instrument called an endoscope is passed down your throat to allow the doctor to look directly at the lining of your oesophagus, the ring of muscle and your stomach. Treatments for achalasia There is no cure for achalasia, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and make swallowing easier. Your doctors will talk to you about the risks and benefits of the different treatment options. Medicine Medicines, such as nitrates or nifedipine , can help to relax the muscles in your oesophagus. This makes swallowing easier and less painful for some people, although they do not work for everyone. The effect only lasts for a short time, so medicine may be used to ease symptoms while you wait for a more permanent treatment. They may cause headaches, but this usually improves over time. Stretching the muscle (balloon dilation) Under a sedative, or sometimes a general anaesthetic , a balloon is passed into the oesophagus using a long, thin flexible tube ( endoscope ). The balloon is then inflated to help stretch the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach. This improves swallowing for most people, but you may need treatment several times before your symptoms improve. Balloon dilatation does carry a small risk of tearing the oesophagus (oesophageal rupture), which may require emergency surgery. Botox injection Using an endoscope, botox is injected into the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach, causing it to relax. It is usually effective for a few months and occasionally for a few years, but it has to be repeated. This is usually painless, and can be used for temporary relief in people who are not able to have other treatments. Surgery Under general anaesthetic, the muscle fibres in the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach are cut. This is done using keyhole surgery ( laparoscopy ) and is called Heller's myotomy. It can permanently make swallowing easier. Often a second procedure will be done at the same time to stop you getting acid reflux and heartburn , which can be a side effect of the Heller's myotomy operation. Your surgeon will talk to you about this and any other surgical options which may be the best option for you. Follow-up treatment Balloon dilation and surgery can both cause side effects such as acid reflux and heartburn and chest pain. A GP may be able to prescribe medicine to help with this, and your surgeon may suggest you take this medicine routinely. It's normal for chest pain to persist for a while after treatment. You should see a GP if you still have swallowing difficulties or are continuing to lose weight after treatment.

    "症状描述": "Symptoms of reflux in babies Reflux usually starts before a baby is 8 weeks old and gets better by the time they're 1. Symptoms of reflux in babies include: bringing up milk or being sick during or shortly after feeding coughing or hiccupping when feeding being unsettled during feeding swallowing or gulping after burping or feeding crying and not settling not gaining weight as they're not keeping enough food down Sometimes babies may have signs of reflux but will not bring up milk or be sick. This is known as silent reflux. Things you can try to ease reflux in babies It's common for a baby under the age of 1 to bring up a little bit of milk during or shortly after a feed, without being distressed. Your baby does not usually need to see a doctor if they have reflux, as long as they're happy, healthy and gaining weight. If symptoms of reflux seem to be bothering your baby, there are things you can do to help. Do ask a health visitor for advice and support get advice about your baby's breastfeeding position or how to bottle feed your baby hold your baby upright during feeding and for as long as possible after feeding burp your baby regularly during feeds make sure your baby sleeps flat on their back (they should not sleep on their side or front) Don’t do not raise the head of their cot or Moses basket Non-urgent advice: See a GP if your baby: is not improving after trying things to ease reflux gets reflux for the first time after they're 6 months old is older than 1 and still has reflux is not gaining weight or is losing weight Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call NHS 111 if your baby: has vomit that's green or yellow, or has blood in it is projectile vomiting (being sick with more force than usual) has blood in their poo has a swollen or tender tummy has a very high temperature, or they feel hot, cold or shivery keeps being sick and cannot keep fluid down has diarrhoea that lasts for over a week or has signs of dehydration will not stop crying and is very distressed is refusing to feed Also call your GP or 111 if you have any other concerns about your baby. Treatment for reflux in babies A GP or specialist may want to check whether your baby has an allergy to cow's milk, because the symptoms can be very similar to reflux. If there's no sign of cow' milk allergy, they may recommend treatments for reflux. If your baby is formula-fed, they may recommend: a powder that's mixed with formula, to thicken it a pre-thickened formula milk If the thickening powder does not help or your baby is breastfed, a GP or specialist might recommend medicines that help with distress from reflux and stop their stomach from producing as much acid. Very rarely, surgery might be needed to strengthen the muscle that stops food or milk travelling back up. This is usually only after trying other things or if their reflux is severe. Causes of reflux Reflux usually happens because the ring of muscle inside your baby's food pipe (oesophagus) can be weak, which allows milk to come back up easily. This muscle will get stronger as your baby gets older and the reflux should stop. Page last reviewed: 10 June 2025 Next review due: 10 June 2028",
