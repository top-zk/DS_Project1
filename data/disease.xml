<dataset><item><text>An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a swelling in the aorta, the artery that carries blood from the heart to the tummy (abdomen). Most aneurysms do not cause any problems, but they can be serious because there's a risk they could burst (rupture). Symptoms of abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal aortic aneurysm often has no symptoms. You usually only find out you have one during an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening test or during tests for another condition. If an aneurysm gets bigger, you might sometimes notice: tummy or back pain a pulsing feeling in your tummy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have tummy or back pain that does not go away or keeps coming back you feel a lump in your tummy These symptoms can be caused by lots of things and do not mean you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, but it's best to get them checked. Immediate action required: Call 999 if you or someone else: have sudden, severe pain in your tummy or back are struggling to breathe or have stopped breathing have pale or grey skin (on brown or black skin this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet) lose consciousness These could be signs of an abdominal aortic aneurysm bursting (rupturing). This is a life-threatening emergency that needs to be treated in hospital as soon as possible. Tests for abdominal aortic aneurysm The main test to find out if you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm is an ultrasound scan of your tummy. A small device is placed on your tummy and images of the inside of your tummy will be shown on a screen. You'll usually be told if you have an aneurysm at the end of the test. You’ll also be told how big it is: small (3cm to 4.4cm or smaller) medium (4.5cm to 5.4cm) large (5.5cm or bigger) Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm An ultrasound test is offered to all men when they turn 65, as they're most at risk of getting an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is called abdominal aortic aneurysm screening . Treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm Treatment for an abdominal aortic aneurysm usually depends on how big it is and if you have symptoms. If it's small, lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and eating healthily may be recommended to help stop it getting bigger. Sometimes you may need: medicines to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol level, which may help stop the aneurysm getting bigger surgery to reduce the risk of the aneurysm bursting - this may be done if your AAA is large (5.5cm or bigger), is quickly getting bigger or is painful Surgery has risks and side effects which your doctor or surgeon should discuss with you. Abdominal aortic aneurysms often get bigger over time. You'll usually need regular scans to see if it's getting bigger. If your aneurysm ruptures, you’ll need emergency surgery to treat it. How to lower your risk of getting an abdominal aortic aneurysm Making healthy lifestyle changes can help lower your risk of getting an abdominal aortic aneurysm, or stop one from getting bigger. Do eat healthily exercise regularly try to lose weight if you're overweight try to cut down on alcohol Don’t do not smoke Information: Find out how to get help to quit smoking Causes of an abdominal aortic aneurysm An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens when the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the tummy (the aorta) becomes weakened. It's not always clear what causes it, but some people have a higher chance of getting one. You’re more at risk if you: are male and aged 65 or over smoke or used to smoke have high blood pressure have high cholesterol have a close relative who's had an abdominal aortic aneurysm have coronary or peripheral artery disease ( atherosclerosis ) have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a condition such as Marfan syndrome Sometimes an abdominal aortic aneurysm can be caused by an infection, but this is rare.

They can appear anywhere on the body. The patches are dry and feel similar to velvet. Credit: Benedicte Desrus / Alamy Stock Photo They're most common in skin folds, such as the armpits, neck or groin. Credit: CID, ISM /SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Some people also have tiny growths (skin tags) on the patches. Credit: ANDRE LABBE, ISM/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY The patches often appear gradually without any other symptoms. Sometimes the skin may be itchy. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have new dark patches on your skin you have any skin changes you're unsure about What happens at your appointment A GP can usually tell if it's acanthosis nigricans by looking at your skin. Although acanthosis nigricans is usually harmless, it's best to get any skin changes checked out. Rarely, it can be a sign of something more serious, such as cancer. You may need some tests to find out what's causing the patches. Causes of acanthosis nigricans The most common cause of acanthosis nigricans is obesity . Other causes include: type 2 diabetes conditions that affect hormone levels – such as Cushing's syndrome , polycystic ovary syndrome or an underactive thyroid taking certain medicines – including steroids or hormone treatments like the contraceptive pill rarely, cancer – usually stomach cancer rarely, a faulty gene inherited from your parents Sometimes healthy people with no other conditions get acanthosis nigricans. This is more common in people with black or brown skin. Treating acanthosis nigricans Once a GP knows what's causing acanthosis nigricans, they can recommend the best treatment. The patches should fade over time once the cause is treated. If you're very overweight, a GP may recommend losing weight. Depending on the cause, they may also recommend: medicine to balance your hormones medicine to balance your insulin levels changing your medicine to one that does not cause the patches There's no specific treatment for the patches themselves. A skin specialist (dermatologist) may be able to suggest treatments to improve their appearance, but finding and treating the cause is usually recommended first.

Normally, the muscles of the oesophagus contract to squeeze food along towards the stomach. A ring of muscle at the end of the food pipe then relaxes to let food into the stomach. In achalasia, the muscles in the oesophagus do not contract correctly and the ring of muscle can fail to open properly, or does not open at all. Food and drink cannot pass into the stomach and becomes stuck. It is often brought back up. Symptoms of achalasia Not everyone with achalasia will have symptoms. But most people with achalasia will find it difficult to swallow food or drink (known as dysphagia ). Swallowing tends to get gradually more difficult or painful over a couple of years, to the point where it is sometimes impossible. Other symptoms include: bringing back up undigested food choking and coughing fits heartburn chest pain repeated chest infections drooling of vomit or saliva gradual but significant weight loss Symptoms of achalasia may start at any time of life. Swallowing problems can also be caused by cancers of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. There’s a link between long-term achalasia and the risk of developing cancer of the oesophagus , but the risk is small. It’s always important to get symptoms checked straight away, even if your symptoms are not bothering you. Causes of achalasia Achalasia is thought to happen when the nerves in the oesophagus become damaged and stop working properly, which is why the muscles and ring of muscle do not work. The exact cause of this is unknown. In some people, it may be linked to a viral infection. It may also be associated with having an autoimmune condition, where the body's immune system attacks healthy cells, tissue and organs. In rare cases, it's possible that achalasia is caused by a faulty gene. Diagnosing achalasia If a GP thinks you have achalasia, you'll be referred to hospital to have some diagnostic tests. Achalasia may also be diagnosed during an investigation, such as a chest X-ray , for another reason. The tests for achalasia include: manometry – a small plastic tube is passed through your mouth or nose into your oesophagus to measure the muscle pressure along it at different points. barium swallow – you drink a white liquid containing the chemical barium and X-rays are taken. The barium shows up clearly on X-ray so the doctor can see how long it takes to move into your stomach. endoscopy – a thin, flexible instrument called an endoscope is passed down your throat to allow the doctor to look directly at the lining of your oesophagus, the ring of muscle and your stomach. Treatments for achalasia There is no cure for achalasia, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and make swallowing easier. Your doctors will talk to you about the risks and benefits of the different treatment options. Medicine Medicines, such as nitrates or nifedipine , can help to relax the muscles in your oesophagus. This makes swallowing easier and less painful for some people, although they do not work for everyone. The effect only lasts for a short time, so medicine may be used to ease symptoms while you wait for a more permanent treatment. They may cause headaches, but this usually improves over time. Stretching the muscle (balloon dilation) Under a sedative, or sometimes a general anaesthetic , a balloon is passed into the oesophagus using a long, thin flexible tube ( endoscope ). The balloon is then inflated to help stretch the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach. This improves swallowing for most people, but you may need treatment several times before your symptoms improve. Balloon dilatation does carry a small risk of tearing the oesophagus (oesophageal rupture), which may require emergency surgery. Botox injection Using an endoscope, botox is injected into the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach, causing it to relax. It is usually effective for a few months and occasionally for a few years, but it has to be repeated. This is usually painless, and can be used for temporary relief in people who are not able to have other treatments. Surgery Under general anaesthetic, the muscle fibres in the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach are cut. This is done using keyhole surgery ( laparoscopy ) and is called Heller's myotomy. It can permanently make swallowing easier. Often a second procedure will be done at the same time to stop you getting acid reflux and heartburn , which can be a side effect of the Heller's myotomy operation. Your surgeon will talk to you about this and any other surgical options which may be the best option for you. Follow-up treatment Balloon dilation and surgery can both cause side effects such as acid reflux and heartburn and chest pain. A GP may be able to prescribe medicine to help with this, and your surgeon may suggest you take this medicine routinely. It's normal for chest pain to persist for a while after treatment. You should see a GP if you still have swallowing difficulties or are continuing to lose weight after treatment.

Symptoms of reflux in babies include: bringing up milk or being sick during or shortly after feeding coughing or hiccupping when feeding being unsettled during feeding swallowing or gulping after burping or feeding crying and not settling not gaining weight as they're not keeping enough food down Sometimes babies may have signs of reflux but will not bring up milk or be sick. This is known as silent reflux. Things you can try to ease reflux in babies It's common for a baby under the age of 1 to bring up a little bit of milk during or shortly after a feed, without being distressed. Your baby does not usually need to see a doctor if they have reflux, as long as they're happy, healthy and gaining weight. If symptoms of reflux seem to be bothering your baby, there are things you can do to help. Do ask a health visitor for advice and support get advice about your baby's breastfeeding position or how to bottle feed your baby hold your baby upright during feeding and for as long as possible after feeding burp your baby regularly during feeds make sure your baby sleeps flat on their back (they should not sleep on their side or front) Don’t do not raise the head of their cot or Moses basket Non-urgent advice: See a GP if your baby: is not improving after trying things to ease reflux gets reflux for the first time after they're 6 months old is older than 1 and still has reflux is not gaining weight or is losing weight Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call NHS 111 if your baby: has vomit that's green or yellow, or has blood in it is projectile vomiting (being sick with more force than usual) has blood in their poo has a swollen or tender tummy has a very high temperature, or they feel hot, cold or shivery keeps being sick and cannot keep fluid down has diarrhoea that lasts for over a week or has signs of dehydration will not stop crying and is very distressed is refusing to feed Also call your GP or 111 if you have any other concerns about your baby. Treatment for reflux in babies A GP or specialist may want to check whether your baby has an allergy to cow's milk, because the symptoms can be very similar to reflux. If there's no sign of cow' milk allergy, they may recommend treatments for reflux. If your baby is formula-fed, they may recommend: a powder that's mixed with formula, to thicken it a pre-thickened formula milk If the thickening powder does not help or your baby is breastfed, a GP or specialist might recommend medicines that help with distress from reflux and stop their stomach from producing as much acid. Very rarely, surgery might be needed to strengthen the muscle that stops food or milk travelling back up. This is usually only after trying other things or if their reflux is severe. Causes of reflux Reflux usually happens because the ring of muscle inside your baby's food pipe (oesophagus) can be weak, which allows milk to come back up easily. This muscle will get stronger as your baby gets older and the reflux should stop.

If it keeps happening, it may be called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Symptoms of acid reflux The main symptoms of acid reflux are: heartburn – a burning sensation in the middle of your chest an unpleasant sour taste in your mouth, caused by stomach acid You may also have: a cough or hiccups that keep coming back a hoarse voice bad breath bloating and feeling sick Symptoms are often worse after eating, when lying down and when bending over. Causes of heartburn and acid reflux Lots of people get heartburn from time to time. There's often no obvious reason why. Sometimes it's caused or made worse by: certain food and drink – such as coffee, tomatoes, alcohol, chocolate and fatty or spicy foods being overweight smoking pregnancy - find out more about indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy stress and anxiety an increase in some types of hormones, such as progesterone and oestrogen some medicines, such as anti-inflammatory painkillers (like ibuprofen ) a hiatus hernia – when part of your stomach moves up into your chest a stomach ulcer a bacterial infection in your stomach How you can ease heartburn and acid reflux yourself Simple lifestyle changes can help stop or reduce heartburn. Do eat smaller, more frequent meals try to lose weight if you're overweight try to find ways to relax Don’t do not have food or drink that triggers your symptoms do not eat within 3 or 4 hours before bed do not wear clothes that are tight around your waist do not smoke do not drink too much alcohol do not stop taking any prescribed medicine without speaking to a doctor first You may find that using wood, bricks or books to raise the head of your bed by around 10 to 20cm, so your chest and head are above your waist, helps relieve symptoms. This can help stop stomach acid travelling up towards your throat. But do not try to achieve the same effect by using additional pillows, as this can increase pressure on your belly and make your symptoms worse. A pharmacist can help with heartburn and acid reflux Speak to a pharmacist for advice if you keep getting heartburn. They may recommend medicines called antacids or alginates that can help ease your symptoms. It's best to take these with food or soon after eating, as this is when you're most likely to get heartburn. They may also work for longer if taken with food. Although antacids and alginates help symptoms in the short term, they will not cure the problem and should not be taken regularly for long periods. If you're pregnant, a pharmacist can advise you about medicines you can take. Find a pharmacy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: lifestyle changes and pharmacy medicines are not helping your heartburn you have heartburn most days you also have other symptoms, like food getting stuck in your throat, frequently being sick, or losing weight for no reason A GP can provide alternative or stronger treatments and help rule out any more serious causes of your symptoms. If at any time you feel your symptoms are getting worse, contact a GP, go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111. Treatment for heartburn and acid reflux from a GP If you have acid reflux, a GP may prescribe a medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces how much acid your stomach makes. PPIs include: omeprazole lansoprazole You'll usually need to take this type of medicine for 4 or 8 weeks, depending on how serious your acid reflux is. Go back to the GP if your symptoms return after stopping your medicine. You may need a long-term prescription. Important If a PPI does not help, your doctor may suggest trying a different type of medicine called an H2 receptor antagonist, such as famotidine. Tests and treatments for severe heartburn and acid reflux If medicines do not help or your symptoms are severe, a GP may refer you to a specialist for: tests to find out what's causing your symptoms, such as a gastroscopy (where a thin tube with a camera inside it is passed down your throat and into your stomach) tests to check for bacteria that can cause heartburn – this can be treated with a combination of antibiotics and PPIs surgery on your stomach or food pipe (oesophagus) to stop acid reflux Page last reviewed: 20 November 2023 Next review due: 20 November 2026</text><label>0</label></item><item><text>An acoustic neuroma is a type of non-cancerous (benign) brain tumour. It's also known as a vestibular schwannoma. A benign brain tumour is a growth in the brain that usually grows slowly over many years and does not spread to other parts of the body. Acoustic neuromas grow on the nerve used for hearing and balance, which can cause problems such as hearing loss and unsteadiness. They can sometimes be serious if they become very large, but most are picked up and treated before they reach this stage. Acoustic neuromas tend to affect adults aged 30 to 60 and usually have no obvious cause, although a small number of cases are the result of a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) . Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma An acoustic neuroma may not cause any obvious symptoms at first. Any symptoms tend to develop gradually and often include: hearing loss that usually only affects 1 ear hearing sounds that come from inside the body ( tinnitus ) the sensation that you're moving or spinning ( vertigo ) A large acoustic neuroma can also sometimes cause: persistent headaches temporary blurred or double vision numbness, pain or weakness on 1 side of the face problems with limb co-ordination ( ataxia ) on 1 side of the body voice changes or difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) Getting medical advice See your GP if you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you're worried could be caused by an acoustic neuroma. Acoustic neuromas can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can be caused by other conditions, such as Ménière's disease . If your GP thinks you could have an acoustic neuroma, you'll be referred to a hospital or clinic for further tests, such as: hearing tests to check for hearing problems and determine whether they're caused by a problem with your nerves an MRI scan , which uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed picture of the inside of your head a CT scan , which uses a series of X-rays to create a detailed image of the inside of your head Treatments for acoustic neuromas There are several different treatment options for an acoustic neuroma, depending on the size and position of your tumour, how fast it's growing and your general health. The main options are: monitoring the tumour – small tumours often just need to be monitored with regular MRI scans, and treatment is generally only recommended if scans show it's getting bigger brain surgery – surgery to remove all or some of the tumour through a cut in the skull may be carried out under general anaesthetic if it's large or getting bigger stereotactic radiosurgery – small tumours, or any pieces of a larger tumour that remain after surgery, may be treated with a precise beam of radiation to stop them getting any bigger All these options carry some risks. For example, surgery and radiosurgery can sometimes cause facial numbness or an inability to move part of your face ( paralysis ). Speak to your specialist about the best option for you and what the benefits and risks are. Outlook for acoustic neuromas Large acoustic neuromas can be serious because they can sometimes cause a life-threatening build-up of fluid in the brain ( hydrocephalus ). But it's rare for them to reach this stage. Many grow very slowly or not at all, and those that grow more quickly can be treated before they become too big. Even with treatment, symptoms such as hearing loss and tinnitus can persist and affect your ability to work, communicate and drive. These problems may need additional treatment. Read more about treating hearing loss and treating tinnitus . An acoustic neuroma can occasionally return after treatment. This is thought to happen to around 1 in every 20 people who have had surgical removal. You'll probably continue having regular MRI scans after any treatment to check if the tumour is growing again or coming back.

They may include: swollen hands and feet tiredness or difficulty sleeping sleep apnoea sweating numbness and weakness in your hands abnormal height growth in children and teenagers (gigantism) body growth – feet, fingers, head, tongue and neck may increase in size headaches joint pain thicker, more oily skin a deeper voice irregular periods erection problems You usually get acromegaly between the ages of 30 and 50 years old, but you can get symptoms at any age. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you may have acromegaly Early diagnosis and treatment can stop symptoms getting worse. Causes of acromegaly Acromegaly is usually caused by an adenoma (a non-cancerous tumour ) in the pituitary gland. This is a pea-sized gland at the back of your brain. An adenoma can cause you to produce too much growth hormone. Acromegaly is not usually passed on from your parents (inherited). What happens at your appointment Acromegaly may take time to be diagnosed. If the GP thinks you have it, they may ask to see photographs of you from the past couple of years to check any changes. They may also refer you to a specialist for tests, including: blood tests an MRI scan of your brain to see if you have a tumour Treatments for acromegaly Treatments for acromegaly can include: surgery to remove the tumour radiotherapy to target the tumour and reduce growth hormone levels injections or tablets to reduce growth hormone levels Treatment usually stops your body producing too much growth hormone and usually improves your symptoms. After treatment, you'll continue to have appointments with a specialist. They can monitor how well your pituitary gland is working and check that your treatment is right for you. Complications of acromegaly Acromegaly can increase your risk of: type 2 diabetes high blood pressure (hypertension) heart disease bowel polyps You'll have regular health checks to monitor these conditions, including colonoscopy screenings to check for bowel polyps. Recording information about you and your condition If you have acromegaly, your care team will pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . This helps scientists find better ways to treat and prevent this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

It's not usually serious, but there's a small chance the patches could become skin cancer. Protecting your skin in the sun and watching out for changes can help. Symptoms of actinic keratoses Actinic keratoses patches: can feel dry, rough and scaly, or like sandpaper are usually between 1cm and 2cm in size can be the same colour as your skin, or range from pink to red to brown may be itchy Credit: NAS Medical / Alamy Stock Photo The patches usually appear on areas of your body that are often exposed to the sun, such as your face, hands and arms, ears, scalp and legs. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you notice new patches on your skin the patches begin to bleed, get bigger, change colour, feel tender or develop into a lump a patch appears on your lips It's important to get these skin changes checked in case they're being caused by something more serious, such as skin cancer. Treatment for actinic keratoses If you only have 1 actinic keratoses patch, a GP might suggest waiting to see if it goes away by itself. If you have more than 1 patch, or a patch is causing you problems such as pain and itchiness, treatment is usually recommended. A GP may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist). Treatments for actinic keratoses include: prescription creams and gels freezing the patches (cryotherapy) – this makes the patches turn into blisters and fall off after a few weeks surgery to cut out or scrape away the patches – you'll be given a local anaesthetic first, so it does not hurt photodynamic therapy (PDT), where special cream is applied to the patches and a light is shone on them Things you can do if you have actinic keratoses There are things you can do to stop your actinic keratoses patches getting worse and lower your chances of developing skin cancer. Do check your skin regularly for any changes use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 before going out in the sun and reapply regularly wear a hat and clothing that fully covers your arms and legs when you're out in the sun Don’t do not sunbathe do not use sunlamps or sunbeds as these can also damage your skin do not go into the sun between 11am and 3pm – this is when the sun is at its strongest Information: Consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day if you always cover up outdoors. This is because you may not get enough vitamin D from sunlight.

It can be very serious but can usually be treated with antibiotics. How you get actinomycosis The bacteria that cause actinomycosis normally live harmlessly in the body. They only cause an infection if they get into the lining of areas such as the mouth or gut. You cannot spread the infection to other people. Any part of the body can be infected, but the head and neck, chest, tummy and pelvis are most commonly affected. Possible causes of actinomycosis include: tooth decay and mouth infections mouth injuries inhaling food or liquid intrauterine devices (IUDs) dental or tummy surgery radiotherapy You're more likely to get actinomycosis if you have type 2 diabetes or a weakened immune system. Symptoms of actinomycosis Symptoms of actinomycosis depend on what part of the body is affected. Actinomycosis symptoms in different areas of the body Area of the body Symptoms Jaw or mouth Lumps in your cheek or neck, difficulty chewing, pus leaking from your skin Lungs Shortness of breath, chest pain, a cough, pus leaking from the skin on your chest Tummy Diarrhoea or constipation, pain, a lump or swelling in your tummy, pus leaking from the skin on your tummy Pelvis Pain low down in your tummy, vaginal bleeding or unusual discharge, a lump or swelling in your lower tummy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have symptoms of actinomycosis Treatment for actinomycosis Actinomycosis is treated with antibiotics. Treatment starts off in hospital with antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously). When you're well enough to go home, you'll be given antibiotic tablets to take for a few months. It's important to keep taking antibiotics until they're finished, even when you feel better. You might also need surgery to drain areas of pus (abscesses) and remove the surrounding area of skin if it's infected. How to prevent actinomycosis Actinomycosis is very rare, so the chances of getting it are extremely small. You can help reduce your risk by looking after your teeth and gums .

It usually happens when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct. Gallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder. The cystic duct is the main opening of the gallbladder. Gallstones are very common, affecting more than 1 in 10 adults in the UK. They do not usually cause symptoms, but can occasionally cause episodes of pain (biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis is potentially serious because of the risk of complications. It usually needs to be treated in hospital with rest, intravenous fluids and antibiotics . Symptoms of acute cholecystitis The main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden, sharp pain in the upper right-hand side of your tummy (abdomen). This pain spreads towards your right shoulder. The affected part of the tummy is usually very tender, and breathing deeply can make the pain worse. Unlike other types of abdominal pain , the pain of acute cholecystitis is usually persistent and does not go away within a few hours. Some people may have additional symptoms, such as: a high temperature feeling sick being sick sweating loss of appetite yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) a bulge in the tummy When to get medical advice See a GP as soon as possible if you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, particularly if it lasts longer than a few hours or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as jaundice and a high temperature. If you're unable to contact a GP immediately, phone your local out-of-hours service or call NHS 111 for advice. It's important for acute cholecystitis to be diagnosed as soon as possible, as there's a risk of serious complications developing if it's not treated promptly. What causes acute cholecystitis? The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2 main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis. Calculous cholecystitis Calculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases. Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or a substance known as biliary sludge. Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile, a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats, and small cholesterol and salt crystals. The blockage in the cystic duct causes bile to build up in the gallbladder, increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. An inflamed gallbladder can sometimes become infected by bacteria. Acalculous cholecystitis Acalculous cholecystitis is gallbladder inflammation without gallstones. It's less common, but usually more serious, than calculous cholecystitis. The exact cause of acalculous cholecystitis is not known, but it's usually a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder. A combination of risk factors may lead to acalculous cholecystitis, including accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries or burns , sepsis , severe malnutrition or dehydration . Diagnosing acute cholecystitis If you have severe tummy pain, a GP will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy's sign. You'll be asked to breathe in deeply with the GP's hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage. Your gallbladder will move downwards as you breathe in. If you have cholecystitis, you'll experience sudden pain as your gallbladder reaches your doctor's hand. If your symptoms suggest you have acute cholecystitis, your GP will refer you to hospital immediately for further tests and treatment. Tests you may have in hospital include: blood tests – to check for signs of inflammation in your body an ultrasound scan of your tummy – to check for gallstones or other signs of a problem with your gallbladder Treating acute cholecystitis If you're diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you'll probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. Initial treatment Initial treatment will usually involve: not eating or drinking (fasting) to take the strain off your gallbladder receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration taking medicine to relieve your pain You'll also be given antibiotics if it's thought you have an infection. These often need to be continued for up to a week, during which time you may need to stay in hospital, or you may be able to go home. Surgery Removing your gallbladder may be recommended at some point after initial treatment to prevent acute cholecystitis coming back and reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications. This type of surgery is known as a cholecystectomy . There are 2 main types of cholecystectomy: open cholecystectomy – where the gallbladder is removed through a single cut in the tummy laparoscopic cholecystectomy – keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts in your abdomen If you're fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder is. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often recommended within 1 week of confirming acute cholecystitis. Some people who have had their gallbladder removed have symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating certain foods, but it's possible to lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. The organ can be useful, but it's not essential as your liver will still produce bile to digest food. Find out more about recovering from gallbladder removal Alternatives to surgery Sometimes surgery may not be an option – for example, if you have another condition that makes surgery unsuitable. If surgery is not an option, you may be offered a procedure to drain away the fluid that has collected in your gallbladder. A narrow tube is inserted into the gallbladder to make an opening for the fluid to drain. This can be done through a cut made in the skin of your tummy, or using an endoscopic procedure (through your mouth and into the stomach). Possible complications Without appropriate treatment, acute cholecystitis can sometimes lead to potentially life-threatening complications. The main complications of acute cholecystitis are: the death of gallbladder tissue (gangrenous cholecystitis) – which can cause a serious infection that could spread throughout the body the gallbladder splitting open (perforated gallbladder) – which can spread the infection within your tummy (peritonitis) or lead to a build-up of pus (abscess) Emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications in about 2 or 3 in every 10 cases of acute cholecystitis. Preventing acute cholecystitis It's not always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can lower your risk of developing it by reducing your risk of getting gallstones. One of the main things you can do to lower your chances of getting gallstones is to adopt a healthy, balanced diet and reduce the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones. Living with overweight or obesity also increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should therefore control your weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly . But low-calorie rapid weight loss diets should be avoided because there's evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and actually increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is best. Find out more about preventing gallstones The gallbladder The gallbladder is a small pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver. Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. The liver produces bile, a liquid that helps digest fats and carries toxins excreted by the liver. Bile is passed from the liver through a series of channels called bile ducts into the gallbladder, where it's stored. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed. It's an organ that's useful, but not essential, and it can be safely removed without interfering with your ability to digest food.

It can range from minor loss of kidney function to complete kidney failure. AKI normally happens as a complication of another serious illness. It's not the result of a physical blow to the kidneys, as the name might suggest. This type of kidney damage is usually seen in older people who are unwell with other conditions and the kidneys are also affected. It's essential that AKI is detected early and treated promptly. Without quick treatment, abnormal levels of salts and chemicals can build up in the body, which affects the ability of other organs to work properly. If the kidneys shut down completely, this may require temporary support from a dialysis machine, or lead to death. AKI can also affect children and young people. Find out more from infoKID about AKI in children Symptoms of acute kidney injury Symptoms of AKI include: feeling sick or being sick diarrhoea dehydration peeing less than usual confusion drowsiness Even if it does not progress to complete kidney failure, AKI needs to be taken seriously. It has an effect on the whole body, changes how some medicines are handled by the body, and could make some existing illnesses more serious. AKI is different from chronic kidney disease , where the kidneys gradually lose function over a long period of time. Who's at risk of acute kidney injury? You're more likely to get AKI if: you're aged 65 or over you already have a kidney problem, such as chronic kidney disease you have a long-term disease, such as heart failure , liver disease or diabetes you're dehydrated or unable to maintain your fluid intake independently you have a blockage in your urinary tract (or are at risk of this) you have a severe infection or sepsis you're taking certain medicines, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) , such as ibuprofen, or blood pressure medicines, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics; diuretics help the kidneys get rid of extra fluid from the body, but may become less helpful when a person is dehydrated or suffering from a severe illness you're given aminoglycosides – a type of antibiotic that's usually only given in hospital; these medicines are only likely to increase the risk of AKI if you're dehydrated or ill Causes of acute kidney injury Most cases of AKI are caused by reduced blood flow to the kidneys, usually in someone who's already unwell with another health condition. This reduced blood flow could be caused by: low blood volume after bleeding, excessive vomiting or diarrhoea, or severe dehydration the heart pumping out less blood than normal as a result of heart failure , liver failure or sepsis certain medicines that reduce blood pressure or blood flow to the kidneys, such as ACE inhibitors, certain diuretics or NSAIDs AKI can also be caused by a problem with the kidney itself, such as inflammation of the filters in the kidney ( glomerulonephritis ), the blood vessels ( vasculitis ), or other structures in the kidney. This may be caused by a reaction to some medicines, infections or the liquid dye used in some types of X-rays. It may sometimes be the result of a blockage affecting the drainage of the kidneys, such as: an enlarged prostate a tumour in the pelvis, such as an ovarian or bladder tumour kidney stones Diagnosing acute kidney injury A doctor may suspect AKI if you: are in an "at risk" group and suddenly fall ill get symptoms of AKI AKI is usually diagnosed with a blood test to measure your levels of creatinine, a chemical waste product produced by the muscles. If there's a lot of creatinine in your blood, it means your kidneys are not working as well as they should. You may also be asked to give a pee sample. Find out more from InfoKID about AKI in children Investigating the underlying cause Urine can be tested for protein, blood cells, sugar and waste products, which may give clues to the underlying cause. Doctors also need to know about: any other symptoms, such as signs of sepsis or signs of heart failure any other medical conditions any medicine that's been taken in the past week, as some medicines can cause AKI An ultrasound scan should reveal if the cause is a blockage in the urinary system, such as an enlarged prostate or bladder tumour. Treating acute kidney injury Treatment of AKI depends on what's causing your illness and how severe it is. You may need: to increase your intake of water and other fluids if you're dehydrated antibiotics if you have an infection to stop taking certain medicines (at least until the problem is sorted) a urinary catheter, a thin tube used to drain the bladder if there's a blockage You may need to go to hospital for some treatments. Most people with AKI make a full recovery, but some people go on to develop chronic kidney disease or long-term kidney failure as a result. In severe cases, dialysis – where a machine filters the blood to rid the body of harmful waste, extra salt and water – may be needed. Preventing acute kidney injury Those at risk of AKI should be monitored with regular blood tests if they become unwell or start new medicine. It's also useful to check how much pee you're passing. Any warning signs of AKI, such as vomiting or producing little pee, require immediate investigation for AKI and treatment. People who are dehydrated or at risk of dehydration may need to be given fluids through a drip. Any medicine that seems to be making the problem worse or directly damaging the kidneys needs to be stopped, at least temporarily. Complications of acute kidney injury The most serious complications of acute kidney injury include: high levels of potassium in the blood – in severe cases, this can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and heart rhythm problems too much fluid in the body, which can cause build-up of fluid in the arms and legs ( oedema ) or in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) acidic blood (metabolic acidosis) – which can cause nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and breathlessness chronic kidney disease Page last reviewed: 08 September 2022 Next review due: 08 September 2025</text><label>0</label></item><item><text>Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means it progresses quickly and aggressively, and usually requires immediate treatment. Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected. The 2 main types of white blood cells are: monocytes and granulocytes, which come from myeloid stem cells lymphocytes, which come from lymphoid stem cells This topic focuses on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is an aggressive cancer of the monocyte or granulocyte cells. The following types of leukaemia are covered separately: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia chronic myeloid leukaemia chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Symptoms of AML The symptoms of AML usually develop over a few weeks and become worse over time. Symptoms can include: looking pale or "washed out" feeling tired or weak breathlessness frequent infections unusual and frequent bruising or bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds losing weight without trying to Seeking medical advice Speak to a GP if you or your child have possible symptoms of AML. Although it's highly unlikely that leukaemia is the cause, these symptoms should be investigated. If your GP thinks you may have leukaemia, they'll arrange blood tests to check your blood cells. If the tests suggest there's a problem, you'll be urgently referred to a specialist in treating blood conditions (haematologist) for further tests and treatment. Find out more about diagnosing AML What causes AML? It's not clear exactly what causes AML and, in most cases, there's no identifiable cause. But some things can increase your risk of getting AML, including: previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy exposure to very high levels of radiation (including previous radiotherapy treatment) smoking and other exposure to benzene, a chemical used in manufacturing that's also found in cigarette smoke having a blood disorder or some genetic conditions, such as Down's syndrome Find out more about the causes of AML Who's affected AML is a rare type of cancer, with around 3,100 people diagnosed with it each year in the UK. The risk of developing AML increases with age. It's most common in people over 75. How AML is treated Treatment for AML needs to begin as soon as possible, as it can develop quickly. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML. It's used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing). In some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a bone marrow or stem cell transplant .

Symptoms of Addison’s disease include: extreme tiredness (fatigue) areas of skin that are darker than surrounding skin – this may be harder to see on brown or black skin loss of appetite, weight loss, tummy pain, feeling or being sick and cravings for salty foods feeling dizzy or light-headed when standing up joint pain, muscle weakness and muscle cramps headache a slightly raised temperature feeling thirsty and needing to pee a lot difficulty concentrating anxiety and depression Addison’s disease most commonly affects adults between the ages of 30 and 50, but it can sometimes affect children. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you think you might have Addison’s disease Tests for Addison's disease If a GP thinks you or your child might have Addison’s disease, they’ll refer you to a specialist. This is usually a hormone specialist (endocrinologist), although children are often referred to a doctor who specialises in the treatment of children (paediatrician). The specialist will ask about your symptoms and you may have: a test to see how well your adrenal glands are working by checking samples of your blood before and after having an injection of a medicine called Synacthen blood tests to check your hormone levels and how well your thyroid gland is working Treatments for Addison's disease There’s currently no cure for Addison’s disease, but there are medicines that can help manage the condition. If you have Addison’s disease, your adrenal glands are not producing enough hormones, including types of hormones called steroids. The main treatment is steroid medicine to replace the missing hormones your body needs. Medicines you may be given include: hydrocortisone prednisolone fludrocortisone You’ll usually need to take your medicine every day for the rest of your life. It’s important you always have enough to avoid running out. At certain times you may need to take extra medicine, such as when you’re unwell, about to have surgery, or during stressful periods like when taking exams. Your specialist will be able to advise you about this. If you’re taking steroids, you should carry a steroid emergency card with you at all times. This tells healthcare professionals you have Addison’s disease and you take steroid medicine that should not be stopped suddenly. You can also get jewellery and wristbands with details of your condition and the medicine you take engraved or printed on them.

There are treatments that can help with any symptoms. Adenomyosis is more commonly diagnosed in women over the age of 30. It can affect anyone who has periods. Credit: Multimedia Team - nhs.uk Symptoms of adenomyosis Some symptoms of adenomyosis affect your periods, such as: painful periods – the pain may be severe and stop you from doing your usual activities heavy bleeding during your period Other symptoms can happen any time in your menstrual cycle, such as: pelvic pain (pain in the lower part of your tummy) bloating, heaviness or fullness in your tummy (abdomen) pain during sex Some people with adenomyosis have no symptoms. Information: Endometriosis is a different condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows in other places, such as the ovaries or fallopian tubes. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: your pelvic pain or period pain is severe or worse than usual, and painkillers have not helped You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: your periods become more painful, heavier or irregular you have pain during sex heavy periods are affecting your life or you've had them for some time you've been feeling bloated for a while (about 3 weeks) you bleed between periods or after sex What happens at your GP appointment The GP may ask about your periods if you have symptoms of adenomyosis. They may feel your tummy to see if there’s any swelling or bloating. You can ask for a female doctor when you book your appointment. The doctor might also ask to do an internal examination, to check your vagina and cervix (the opening between the vagina and the womb). You can have a friend, family member or other member of staff in the room with you during your examination if you want. Sometimes further tests are needed to find out what’s causing your symptoms, or to rule out similar conditions such as endometriosis. Tests may include: ultrasound scan MRI scan Treatments for adenomyosis If you’re diagnosed with adenomyosis, there are treatments that can help ease your symptoms. Treatments include: the IUS (intrauterine system, also called Mirena or hormonal coil), which thins the womb lining, making your periods lighter and less painful other types of hormonal contraception if you cannot or do not want to have an IUS, such as the progestogen-only pill , the combined pill or the contraceptive patch medicines such as tranexamic acid or NSAIDs If these treatments do not work, you may need surgery. This could be a hysterectomy , or surgery to remove the lining of your womb (endometrial ablation). How to ease symptoms of adenomyosis There are things that can help with period pain or pelvic pain caused by adenomyosis. Do use a heat pad or hot water bottle wrapped in a tea towel on your tummy try a TENS machine – a small device that uses mild electrical impulses to reduce pain take painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen Who is more likely to get adenomyosis?

It's a lifelong condition, but it does not get worse over time. People with albinism have a reduced amount of melanin, or no melanin at all. This can affect their colouring and their eyesight. People with albinism often have white or very light blonde hair, although some have brown or red hair. The exact colour depends on how much melanin their body produces. Very pale skin that burns easily in the sun and does not usually tan is also typical of albinism. Eye problems The reduced amount of melanin can cause eye problems. This is because melanin is involved in the development of the retina, the thin layer of cells at the back of the eye. Possible eye problems linked to albinism include: poor eyesight – either short-sightedness or long-sightedness , and low vision (sight loss that cannot be corrected) astigmatism – where the cornea (clear layer at the front of the eye) is not perfectly curved or the lens is an abnormal shape, causing blurred vision photophobia – where the eyes are sensitive to light nystagmus – where the eyes move involuntarily from side to side, causing reduced vision; you do not see the world as "wobbling" because your brain adapts to your eye movement squint – where the eyes point in different directions Some young children with albinism may appear clumsy. This is because problems with their eyesight can make some movements difficult for them, such as picking up an object. This should improve as they get older. How albinism is passed on The 2 main types of albinism are: oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) – the most common type, affecting the skin, hair and eyes ocular albinism (OA) – a rarer type that mainly affects the eyes Autosomal recessive inheritance In all types of OCA and some types of OA, albinism is passed on in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This means a child has to get 2 copies of the gene that causes albinism (1 from each parent) to have the condition. If both parents carry the gene, there's a 1 in 4 chance that their child will have albinism and a 1 in 2 chance that their child will be a carrier. Carriers do not have albinism but can pass on the gene. X-linked inheritance Most types of OA are passed on in an X-linked inheritance pattern. This pattern affects boys and girls differently: girls who get the albinism gene usually become carriers only, while boys who get it will have albinism. When a mother is a carrier of an X-linked type of albinism, each of her daughters has a 1 in 2 chance of becoming a carrier. Each of her sons has a 1 in 2 chance of having albinism. When a father has an X-linked type of albinism, his daughters will become carriers, and his sons will not have albinism and will not be carriers. Genetic counselling If you have a history of albinism in your family or you have a child with the condition, you may want to talk to a GP about getting a referral for genetic counselling. A genetic counsellor provides information, support and advice about genetic conditions. For example, you can discuss with them how you inherited albinism and the chances of passing it on. Read more about genetic and genomic testing Diagnosing albinism Albinism is usually obvious from a baby's appearance when they're born. Your baby's hair, skin and eyes may be examined to look for signs of missing pigment. As albinism can cause a number of eye problems, your baby may be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for tests. Electrodiagnostic testing is also sometimes used to help diagnose albinism. This is where small electrodes are stuck to the scalp to test the connections of the eyes to the part of the brain that controls vision. Treatments for eye problems due to albinism Although there's no cure for the eye problems caused by albinism, there are a number of treatments, such as glasses and contact lenses, that can improve vision. A child with albinism may also need extra help and support at school. Glasses and contact lenses As a child with albinism gets older, they'll need regular eye tests , and it's likely they'll need to wear glasses or contact lenses to correct vision problems. Low-vision aids Vision aids include: large-print or high-contrast books and printed materials magnifying lenses a small telescope or telescopic lenses that attach to glasses to read writing in the distance, such as on a school whiteboard large computer screens software that can turn speech into typing or vice versa tablets and phones that allow you to magnify the display to make writing and images easier to see The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has more information about living with low vision, including a section on education and learning Photophobia or sensitivity to light Sunglasses, tinted glasses and wearing a wide-brimmed hat outside can help with sensitivity to light. Nystagmus There's currently no cure for nystagmus (where the eyes move from side to side involuntarily). However, it is not painful and does not get worse. Certain toys or games may help a child make the most of the vision they have. An ophthalmologist will be able to provide further advice. Surgery, involving dividing and then reattaching some of the eye muscles, may sometimes be an option. Squint and lazy eye The main treatments for squints are glasses, eye exercises, surgery and injections into the eye muscles. If your child has developed a lazy eye, they may benefit from wearing a patch over their "good" eye to encourage their other eye to work harder. Read more about treatments for squints Reducing the risk of sunburn and skin cancer Because people with albinism lack melanin in their skin, they're at increased risk of getting sunburn and skin cancer . If you have albinism, you should wear sunscreen with a high sun-protection factor (SPF). An SPF of 30 or more will provide the best protection. You should also spend time in the shade when the sun is strongest and cover up with suitable clothing and sunglasses. It's also a good idea to look out for skin changes, such as: a new mole, growth or lump any moles, freckles or patches of skin that change in size, shape or colour Report these to a doctor as soon as possible. Skin cancer is much easier to treat if it's found early. Help and support There's usually no reason why someone with albinism cannot do well in schooling, further education and employment. With appropriate help and support, children with albinism can attend a mainstream school. You might like to talk to other people with albinism. The Albinism Fellowship runs meetings around the UK, and has phone and email support . Information about you If you or your child has albinism, your clinical team will pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

To keep health risks from alcohol to a low level, both men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week. A unit of alcohol is 8g or 10ml of pure alcohol, which is about: half a pint of lower to normal-strength lager/beer/cider (ABV 3.6%) a single small shot measure (25ml) of spirits (25ml, ABV 40%) A small glass (125ml, ABV 12%) of wine contains about 1.5 units of alcohol. Find out more about alcohol units Low-risk drinking advice To keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low: men and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week on a regular basis if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it's best to spread this evenly over 3 or more days if you're trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, it's a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week if you're pregnant or trying to become pregnant, the safest approach is to not drink alcohol at all to keep risks to your baby to a minimum Regular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most days and weeks. The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis. Risks of alcohol misuse Short term The short-term risks of alcohol misuse include: accidents and injuries requiring hospital treatment, such as a head injury violent behaviour and being a victim of violence unprotected sex that could potentially lead to unplanned pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) loss of personal possessions, such as wallets, keys or mobile phones alcohol poisoning – this may lead to vomiting, fits (seizures) and falling unconscious People who binge drink (drink heavily over a short period of time) are more likely to behave recklessly and are at greater risk of being in an accident. Long term Persistent alcohol misuse increases your risk of serious health conditions, including: heart disease stroke liver disease liver cancer bowel cancer mouth cancer breast cancer pancreatitis damage to the brain, which can lead to problems with thinking and memory As well as causing serious health problems, long-term alcohol misuse can lead to social problems for some people, such as unemployment, divorce, domestic abuse and homelessness. If someone loses control over their drinking and has an excessive desire to drink, it's known as dependent drinking (alcoholism). Dependent drinking usually affects a person's quality of life and relationships, but they may not always find it easy to see or accept this. Severely dependent drinkers are often able to tolerate very high levels of alcohol in amounts that would dangerously affect or even kill some people. A dependent drinker usually experiences physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms if they suddenly cut down or stop drinking, including: hand tremors – "the shakes" sweating seeing things that are not real (visual hallucinations ) depression anxiety difficulty sleeping (insomnia) This often leads to "relief drinking" to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Find out more about the risks of alcohol misuse Am I drinking too much alcohol? You could be misusing alcohol if: you feel you should cut down on your drinking other people have been criticising your drinking you feel guilty or bad about your drinking you need a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover Someone you know may be misusing alcohol if: they regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week they're sometimes unable to remember what happened the night before because of their drinking they fail to do what was expected of them as a result of their drinking (for example, missing an appointment or work because they're drunk or hungover) Getting help If you're concerned about your drinking or someone else's, a good first step is to see a GP. They'll be able to discuss the services and treatments available. Your alcohol intake may be assessed using tests, such as the: Alcohol use disorders identification test (PDF, 224kb) – a widely used screening test that can help determine whether you need to change your drinking habits Alcohol use disorders identification test consumption (PDF, 382kb) – a simpler test to check whether your drinking has reached dangerous levels As well as the NHS, there are a number of charities and support groups across the UK that provide support and advice for people with an alcohol misuse problem. For example, you may want to contact: Drinkline national alcohol helpline on 0300 123 1110 Alcohol Change UK Alcoholics Anonymous helpline on 0800 9177 650 Al-Anon Family Groups helpline on 0800 0086 811 Treating alcohol misuse How alcohol misuse is treated depends on how much alcohol a person is drinking. Treatment options include: counselling – including self-help groups and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medicines detoxification – this involves a nurse or doctor supporting you to safely stop drinking; this can be done by helping you slowly cut down over time or by giving you medicines to prevent withdrawal symptoms There are 2 main types of medicines to help people stop drinking. The first is to help stop withdrawal symptoms and is given in reducing doses over a short period of time. The most common of these medicines is chlordiazapoxide (Librium). The second is a medicine to reduce any urge you may have to drink. The most common medicines used for this are acamprosate and naltrexone. These are both given at a fixed dose, and you'll usually be on them for 6 to 12 months.

Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, and the risk increases the more you drink. The Chief Medical Officers for the UK recommend that if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all to keep the risk to your baby to a minimum. If you're worried about alcohol use during pregnancy, talk to your doctor or midwife. If you're trying to conceive, your partner should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, which should be spread evenly over 3 days or more. Drinking alcohol excessively can affect the quality of his sperm.

It can make you seriously ill and you may need to go to hospital for treatment. Symptoms of alcohol poisoning Symptoms start after drinking a lot of alcohol and may include: confusion slurring words or being unable to speak being unable to coordinate movement, for example, being unable to stand, walk, or pick things up being sick peeing or pooing yourself pale or blue-tinged skin - on black or brown skin this may be easier to see inside the lips, on the gums and under the fingernails slow or irregular breathing having a seizure or fit loss of consciousness Immediate action required: Call 999 if: you think someone has alcohol poisoning you or someone else has had a seizure or fit someone has lost consciousness someone has stopped breathing Information: Do not drive yourself to A&amp;E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. Things you can do to help someone who has drunk too much alcohol Do stay with them because there's a risk they could choke on their own sick or stop breathing sit them up if they're awake, or put them in the recovery position if they've passed out and check they're breathing properly give them water to sip if they're able to swallow keep them warm with a jacket or blanket Don’t do not let them drink more alcohol do not give them coffee or drinks containing caffeine because this can dehydrate people with alcohol poisoning do not put them in a cold shower or bath because there's a risk they could get too cold, fall or lose consciousness in the water do not try to make them sick Treatment for alcohol poisoning You'll need to go to hospital to be monitored if you have alcohol poisoning. It can cause serious complications, like liver and heart failure, which can be fatal. You may be given fluids, which may be given into your veins with a drip. You may also be given help with your breathing until the effects of the alcohol wear off. Causes of alcohol poisoning Alcohol poisoning is usually caused by binge drinking, which is where you have a lot of alcohol in one drinking session. It can happen when you drink alcohol faster than your body can filter it out of your blood. Having too much alcohol in your blood stops your body working properly and can be life-threatening. Alcohol affects people differently. Some people may be able to drink more alcohol than others, with fewer effects.

There are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms. Symptoms of alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) ARLD does not usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged. When this happens, symptoms can include: feeling sick weight loss loss of appetite yellowing of the whites of the eyes or skin ( jaundice ) swelling in the ankles and tummy confusion or drowsiness vomiting blood or passing blood in your stools This means ARLD is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage. If you regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your GP so they can check if your liver is damaged. Alcohol and the liver The liver is one of the most complex organs in the body. Its functions include: filtering toxins from the blood aiding digestion of food regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels helping fight infection and disease The liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die. The liver can develop new cells, but prolonged alcohol misuse (drinking too much) over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can result in serious and permanent damage to your liver. ARLD is common in the UK. The number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades as a result of increasing levels of alcohol misuse. Read more about the causes of ARLD Stages of ARLD There are 3 main stages of ARLD, although there's often an overlap between each stage. These stages are explained here. Alcoholic fatty liver disease Drinking a large amount of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. This is called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD. Fatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it's an important warning sign that you're drinking at a harmful level. Fatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for some time (months or years), your liver should return to normal. Alcoholic hepatitis Alcoholic hepatitis, which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis , is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol. Less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking). The liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently. Severe alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious and life-threatening illness. Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage. Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is a stage of ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred. Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms. It's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy. Treating alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. This reduces the risk of further damage to your liver and gives it the best chance of recovering. If a person is dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. But support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol addiction support services . A liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and does not improve when you stop drinking alcohol. You'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you have developed complications of cirrhosis despite having stopped drinking. All liver transplant units require people with ARLD to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of their life. Complications Death rates linked to ARLD have risen considerably over the last few decades. Alcohol misuse is now one of the most common causes of death in the UK, along with smoking and high blood pressure . Life-threatening complications of ARLD include: internal (variceal) bleeding build-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy) fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure liver cancer increased vulnerability to infection Read more about the complications of ARLD Preventing alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) The most effective way to prevent ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the recommended limits: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over 3 days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week if you want to cut down, try to have several drink-free days each week A unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal-strength lager or a pub measure (25ml) of spirits. Even if you have been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short-term and long-term benefits for your liver and overall health.

For most people it's easy to treat with medicines from a pharmacist. Symptoms of allergic rhinitis Common symptoms of allergic rhinitis are similar to a cold and include: sneezing an itchy nose a runny or blocked nose itchy, red and watery eyes a cough the roof of your mouth being itchy This usually happens within minutes of coming into contact with something you're allergic to. Causes of allergic rhinitis Allergic rhinitis is caused by an allergic reaction. Common allergies include: pollen from trees, grass and weeds ( hay fever ) house dust mites animals such as dogs and cats mould wood dust, flour dust and latex You're more likely to get an allergy if people in your family also have them or conditions such as eczema and asthma . Information: Allergic rhinitis is different from non-allergic rhinitis , which is caused by things like having a cold, very hot or cold temperatures and humidity. How you can treat allergic rhinitis yourself You can often treat allergic rhinitis without seeing a GP. If you can, try to avoid the things that trigger your allergies. A pharmacist can also advise you about medicines that can help, such as: antihistamines decongestant nasal sprays or drops to unblock your nose (decongestants should not be used by children under 6) salt water nasal sprays or solutions to rinse out the inside of your nose You can buy nasal sprays without a prescription, but they should not be used for more than a week as this can make your symptoms worse.

Wash your hands. Stand over a sink, cup the palm of 1 hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it. Sniff the water into 1 nostril at a time. Breathe through your mouth and allow the water to pour back into the sink. Try not to let the water go down the back of your throat. Repeat the first 5 steps up to 3 times a day (making a new solution each time) until your nose feels more comfortable. If you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better.

The symptoms can be mild, but for some people they can be very serious. Causes of allergies Things that cause allergic reactions are called allergens. Common allergens include: tree and grass pollen ( hay fever ) house dust mites foods, such as peanuts, milk and eggs ( food allergy ) animals, particularly pets like cats and dogs insect stings, such as bee and wasp stings certain medicines Symptoms of an allergic reaction Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include: a runny nose or sneezing pain or tenderness around your cheeks, eyes or forehead coughing, wheezing or breathlessness itchy skin or a raised rash ( hives ) diarrhoea feeling or being sick swollen eyes, lips, mouth or throat Immediate action required: Call 999 if: your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air) your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet) you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy someone faints and cannot be woken up a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face) You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised or itchy.

It usually gets better in a few days with rest, but it can sometimes be life-threatening and need treatment. Check if you're at risk of altitude sickness You can get altitude sickness if you're in a place that is at a high altitude (usually more than 2,500 metres above sea level). You're more likely to get it if you travel or climb to a high altitude quickly. You can get it in places like: Mount Everest in Nepal Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania some places in the Alps La Paz in Bolivia You cannot get altitude sickness in the UK.

How to reduce your risk of altitude sickness There are some things you can do to help reduce your risk of getting altitude sickness. Do travel or climb to a high altitude slowly to give your body time to get used to lower oxygen levels spend a few days at an altitude below 2,500 metres before going any higher have a rest day at the same altitude every 3 to 4 days (if you're at an altitude of 3,000 metres or more) drink enough water so you do not get dehydrated speak to a GP or travel clinic if you've had altitude sickness before or if you're travelling to a high altitude quickly – they may prescribe medicine to help prevent altitude sickness Don’t try not to travel from an altitude that's less than 1,200 metres to an altitude that's more than 3,500 metres in 1 day try not to fly directly to a place with a high altitude – if this is not possible, rest for 1 day before going any higher try not to sleep more than 500 metres higher than you slept the night before (if you're at an altitude of 3,000 metres or more) do not drink alcohol while travelling or climbing Page last reviewed: 31 July 2023 Next review due: 31 July 2026</text><label>0</label></item><item><text>Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK. Dementia is the name for a group of symptoms associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning. It can affect memory, thinking skills and other mental abilities. The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet fully understood, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: increasing age a family history of the condition untreated depression , although depression can also be one of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease lifestyle factors and conditions associated with cardiovascular disease Read more about the causes of Alzheimer's disease . Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually over many years and eventually become more severe. It affects multiple brain functions. The first sign of Alzheimer's disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, this could be forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects. As the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and further symptoms can develop, such as: confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places difficulty planning or making decisions problems with speech and language problems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks behaviour changes, such as becoming aggressive or suspicious of others hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue) low mood or anxiety Read more about the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease . Who is affected? Alzheimer's disease is most common in people over the age of 65. The risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80. But around 1 in every 13 people with Alzheimer's disease are under the age of 65. This is called early- or young-onset Alzheimer's disease. Getting a diagnosis As the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there's a problem. Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older. Also, the disease process itself may (but not always) prevent people recognising changes in their memory. But Alzheimer's disease is not a "normal" part of the ageing process. An accurate and timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can give you the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support that may help. If you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see a GP. If possible, someone who knows you well should be with you as they can help describe any changes or problems they have noticed. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. There's no single test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. And it's important to remember that memory problems do not necessarily mean you have Alzheimer's disease. A GP will ask questions about any problems you're experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions. If Alzheimer's disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist service to: assess your symptoms in more detail organise further testing, such as brain scans if necessary create a treatment and care plan Read more about diagnosing Alzheimer's disease . How Alzheimer's disease is treated There's currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medicines are available that can help relieve some of the symptoms. Various other types of support are also available to help people with Alzheimer's live as independently as possible, such as making changes to your home environment so it's easier to move around and remember daily tasks. Psychological treatments such as cognitive stimulation therapy may also be offered to help support your memory, problem solving skills and language ability. Read more about treating Alzheimer's disease . Outlook People with Alzheimer's disease can live for several years after they start to develop symptoms. But this can vary considerably from person to person. Alzheimer's disease is a life-limiting illness, although many people diagnosed with the condition will die from another cause. As Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological condition, it can cause problems with swallowing. This can lead to aspiration (food being inhaled into the lungs), which can cause frequent chest infections. It's also common for people with Alzheimer's disease to eventually have difficulty eating and have a reduced appetite. There's increasing awareness that people with Alzheimer's disease need palliative care . This includes support for families, as well as the person with Alzheimer's. Can Alzheimer's disease be prevented? As the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not clear, there's no known way to prevent the condition. But there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as: stopping smoking and cutting down on alcohol eating a healthy, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight staying physically fit and mentally active These measures have other health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease and improving your overall mental health. Read more about preventing Alzheimer's disease . Dementia research There are dozens of dementia research projects going on around the world, many of which are based in the UK. If you have a diagnosis of dementia or are worried about memory problems, you can help scientists better understand the disease by taking part in research. If you're a carer for someone with dementia, you can also take part in research. You can sign up to take part in trials on the NHS Join Dementia Research website .
