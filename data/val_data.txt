A lazy eye (amblyopia) is when the vision in 1 eye does not develop properly. Rarely, both eyes can be affected. Symptoms of a lazy eye A lazy eye does not always cause symptoms and is often first diagnosed during an eye test. The main symptoms include: shutting 1 eye or squinting when looking at things eyes pointing in different directions (a squint ) not being able to follow an object or person with your eyes tilting your head when looking at something having tired eyes and rubbing your eyes a lot headaches difficulty catching or throwing tripping or falling over a lot blinking a lot Many children do not notice anything wrong with their vision. You can check a younger child's eyes by covering each eye with your hand, 1 at a time. They may complain if you cover their good eye. Older children may say they're not able to see as well with 1 eye and may have problems with reading, writing and drawing. Non-urgent advice: Go to an opticians if: you're worried about your or your child's vision you have not had an eye test for 2 years Find an NHS sight test What happens during an eye test To check if you or your child have a lazy eye, an eye test specialist called an optometrist will usually do an eye test. You'll be asked to look at lights or read letters while different lenses are placed in front of your eyes. To check the health of your eyes, you or your child may be given eye drops so the optometrist can see the back of your eye more clearly. If you or your child needs glasses, you'll be given a prescription. You can take this to any optician.

Treatment for a lazy eye aims to improve vision in the weaker eye. This may include: wearing glasses to correct your vision wearing an eye patch over the stronger eye for a few hours a day for several months – these are usually worn with glasses using eye drops to temporarily blur vision in the stronger eye Treatment should ideally start before the age of 7, when vision is still developing. If lazy eye is caused by cataracts or a drooping eyelid, you may need surgery. You may also need to have surgery if you have a squint. This will straighten the eyes and allow them to work together better, but does not improve your vision. Help with the cost of glasses and contact lenses Some people are entitled to a voucher to help towards the cost of glasses or contact lenses, including: children aged under 18, or under 19 and in full-time education if you're on some benefits, including Universal Credit If you do not have a voucher, you'll have to pay for glasses or contact lenses.

Actinomycosis is a rare type of bacterial infection. It can be very serious but can usually be treated with antibiotics. How you get actinomycosis The bacteria that cause actinomycosis normally live harmlessly in the body. They only cause an infection if they get into the lining of areas such as the mouth or gut. You cannot spread the infection to other people. Any part of the body can be infected, but the head and neck, chest, tummy and pelvis are most commonly affected. Possible causes of actinomycosis include: tooth decay and mouth infections mouth injuries inhaling food or liquid intrauterine devices (IUDs) dental or tummy surgery radiotherapy You're more likely to get actinomycosis if you have type 2 diabetes or a weakened immune system. Symptoms of actinomycosis Symptoms of actinomycosis depend on what part of the body is affected. Actinomycosis symptoms in different areas of the body Area of the body Symptoms Jaw or mouth Lumps in your cheek or neck, difficulty chewing, pus leaking from your skin Lungs Shortness of breath, chest pain, a cough, pus leaking from the skin on your chest Tummy Diarrhoea or constipation, pain, a lump or swelling in your tummy, pus leaking from the skin on your tummy Pelvis Pain low down in your tummy, vaginal bleeding or unusual discharge, a lump or swelling in your lower tummy Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have symptoms of actinomycosis Treatment for actinomycosis Actinomycosis is treated with antibiotics. Treatment starts off in hospital with antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously). When you're well enough to go home, you'll be given antibiotic tablets to take for a few months. It's important to keep taking antibiotics until they're finished, even when you feel better. You might also need surgery to drain areas of pus (abscesses) and remove the surrounding area of skin if it's infected. How to prevent actinomycosis Actinomycosis is very rare, so the chances of getting it are extremely small. You can help reduce your risk by looking after your teeth and gums .

Amyloidosis is a group of rare conditions where a protein called amyloid builds up in your body. It can affect organs such as your heart, kidneys, liver, nerves or digestive system. It cannot be cured, but there are treatments that may help with symptoms. Symptoms of amyloidosis Common symptoms of amyloidosis include: feeling very tired or weak losing weight without trying to shortness of breath swollen feet or legs bruising around your eyes Other symptoms depend on which parts of your body are affected, so you may not have all the symptoms. They can include: a fast or slow heartbeat or chest pain, if your heart is affected loss of appetite, feeling or being sick, diarrhoea or constipation, if your digestive system is affected frothy pee, if your kidneys are affected pain, numbness or tingling in your hands and feet, if your nerves are affected Important These symptoms can be caused by many different conditions. Having them does not definitely mean you have amyloidosis. But it's important to get them checked by a GP. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: you have symptoms of amyloidosis How you get amyloidosis There are several types of amyloidosis, with different causes. Causes of the main types of amyloidosis Type Cause AL amyloidosis A problem with your bone marrow. Sometimes linked with multiple myeloma , a type of bone marrow cancer. AA amyloidosis Long-term inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis , Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis , or infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) . Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis An inherited genetic condition. Wild-type ATTR amyloidosis Develops as you get older, usually affecting men over 75 years old. Beta-2 microglobulin amyloidosis Having long-term dialysis . Tests for amyloidosis If a GP thinks you may have amyloidosis they'll refer you to a specialist. You may be seen in a specialist amyloidosis treatment centre. Amyloidosis is often hard to diagnose because the symptoms vary and are similar to other conditions. You'll usually have tests such as: blood tests and urine tests tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) , echocardiogram or MRI scan , to check your heart and other organs a biopsy , where a small sample of cells is removed and tested to check for amyloid a type of scan called a SAP scan, to show where amyloid has built up in your body genetic testing to find out if you have a hereditary type of amyloidosis These tests will show what type of amyloidosis you have and how it's affecting you. Treatments for amyloidosis There's no cure for amyloidosis, but some types can be managed well through treatment to improve the symptoms. But for some people, amyloidosis eventually leads to organs such as your heart or kidneys no longer working properly. Your doctor will explain your treatment options and what to expect. If your amyloidosis is caused by another health condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis, treating the condition can improve your symptoms. Other treatments depend on what type of amyloidosis you have and what parts of your body are affected. Treatments may include: medicines to help with symptoms, such as painkillers, anti-sickness medicines, or medicines that reduce swelling (diuretics) medicines to reduce the amount of amyloid your body produces kidney dialysis , if your kidneys are not working properly a kidney transplant or liver transplant, if these organs are damaged Treatments for AL amyloidosis If you have AL amyloidosis, caused by a problem with your bone marrow, you may be offered: chemotherapy to destroy the blood cells in your bone marrow that cause the condition a stem cell or bone marrow transplant Recording information about you and your condition If you have amyloidosis, your care team will pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) . This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

Symptoms of appendicitis Symptoms of appendicitis usually start with pain in the middle of your abdomen (tummy), around your belly button. After a few hours the pain usually moves to the lower right side of your abdomen, and gets worse. The pain may feel worse when you move, cough or press on the area. It may feel slightly better when you pull your knees up to your chest. Some people with appendicitis do not have the usual pain symptoms. For example, you might have pain that's less severe, develops more slowly, or in a different place. This can be more likely if you're pregnant and in young children and older people. Other symptoms of appendicitis can include: feeling or being sick, or loss of appetite a high temperature constipation or diarrhoea peeing more than usual sudden confusion (in older people) If appendicitis is not treated quickly, your appendix can burst. If this happens your pain may suddenly get better for a short time. You'll then usually have severe pain that spreads to the whole of your abdomen. It may be very painful to move. If you're not sure it's appendicitis Many other conditions can cause pain in your abdomen, including: urinary tract infections kidney stones or gallstones bowel problems such as irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease conditions affecting your womb or ovaries, such as pelvic inflammatory disease or a ruptured ovarian cyst an ectopic pregnancy But do not try to diagnose the problem yourself. Get medical help if you're worried. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You or your child have pain in your abdomen (tummy) that: is gradually getting worse or does not go away moves to the lower right side of your abdomen You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: You or your child have: severe pain in your abdomen (tummy) confusion, blotchy or paler than usual skin (on brown or black skin this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet) or difficulty breathing – these could be signs of sepsis Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. How appendicitis is diagnosed If you have symptoms of appendicitis, a GP or hospital doctor will feel your abdomen (tummy) to check for pain and swelling. You'll need to go to hospital for tests and treatment. Tests you may have include: blood tests testing a sample of your pee scans such as an ultrasound scan or CT scan to check for swelling in your appendix a pregnancy test if there's a chance you could be pregnant There's no test that can always show if you have appendicitis. It can be hard to diagnose because the symptoms can be similar to other conditions. Sometimes doctors will try waiting a few hours to see how your symptoms develop in hospital. If your symptoms mean it's very likely you have appendicitis, or if your appendix may have burst, doctors may recommend surgery instead of waiting for more tests. Treatment for appendicitis Appendicitis is usually treated with surgery to remove your appendix (an appendectomy). You do not need your appendix, so it's not harmful to remove it. If you need surgery, it will be done as soon as possible, but you may need to wait a few hours. The operation usually takes about an hour. The main steps of an appendectomy are: You'll be given a general anaesthetic , so you'll be asleep and will not feel any pain. The surgeon makes some small cuts in your abdomen (tummy), and uses a thin tube with a camera to see your appendix ( keyhole surgery ). Sometimes they'll need to make a larger cut in the lower right side of your abdomen (open surgery). The surgeon removes your appendix by cutting where it's joined to your bowel. If your appendix has burst, the area will be cleaned. Your abdomen is closed with stitches, clips or glue. Sometimes it's possible to treat appendicitis with antibiotics rather than surgery. This may be recommended if the infection has not spread and surgery is high risk for you. Sometimes appendicitis causes a lump where part of your abdomen and bowel stick to your appendix, called an appendix mass. If this happens you'll usually need antibiotics first, and then surgery a few weeks later if you still have symptoms. Information: Find out more about hospital treatment Going into hospital Having an operation (surgery) Recovering from appendicitis Most people recover from appendicitis in 1 to 2 weeks. It may take longer if you had complications such as a burst appendix. After surgery for appendicitis: you'll have some small wounds in your abdomen (tummy) you'll usually have stitches that dissolve so they do not need to be removed you may have some pain in your abdomen and around your wounds you may have constipation or diarrhoea for several days Recovering in hospital After surgery for appendicitis, you'll spend some time in the recovery room, before moving to a ward. You'll be given medicine to help with pain. How long you'll stay in hospital can vary. If you had keyhole surgery you may be able to go home the day after the operation. If you had open surgery, or any complications, you may need to stay in hospital for a few days. You can go home when doctors think you're well enough. They'll usually want to check that you're eating and drinking, and you're able to poo. You might be offered a follow-up appointment at the hospital or with a GP, but this is not always needed. Recovering at home There are things you can do to help your recovery. Do start going back to your usual activities when you feel ready – you may need to take 1 to 2 weeks off work or school, or sometimes longer depending on the type of work you do take painkillers if you need them follow advice you're given about caring for your wounds while they heal be careful when washing or showering, and replace your dressings if they get wet if you have constipation , eat plenty of fibre and drink lots of fluids – you could also take a mild laxative (ask a pharmacist for advice) if you're given antibiotics , make sure you finish the whole course of treatment contact the hospital ward where you had your treatment, or speak to a GP or practice nurse, if you need any advice about your recovery Don’t do not do strenuous activities such as sport until you've fully recovered – ask your doctor for advice do not drive until you can use a car safely and comfortably, including doing an emergency stop Possible complications of surgery for appendicitis There's a chance of complications during or after surgery to remove your appendix (an appendectomy), but these are rare. Your doctor will explain the risks to you before the operation. Complications can include: the wound becoming infected bleeding scar tissue forming (adhesions), which can cause a blockage in your bowel in rare cases an abscess forming where your appendix was removed appendicitis coming back in the small part of your appendix that was not removed (stump appendicitis) Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You've recently had an appendectomy and you have: soreness or redness around your wound that's getting worse (redness may be less obvious on brown or black skin) bleeding or pus from your wound a high temperature These could be signs of an infection. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online . Risks of a burst appendix A burst appendix (also called a perforated or ruptured appendix) is a serious condition that can lead to complications such as: an infection of the inner lining of your abdomen ( peritonitis ) a life-threatening reaction to infection ( sepsis ) a painful build-up of pus (abscess) a blockage in your bowel problems in pregnancy These complications will need to be treated urgently with surgery and antibiotics. Causes of appendicitis The appendix is a small pouch that's joined to your bowel in the lower right side of your abdomen (tummy). Appendicitis happens when your appendix becomes infected and swollen. This is often caused by something getting stuck in your appendix, such as a small piece of undigested food or hard poo. Appendicitis is common. It can happen at any age, but it's most common in children over 10 years old and young adults. It's rare in babies under 12 months old. Video: what is appendicitis?

Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake. There are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms. Symptoms of alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) ARLD does not usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged. When this happens, symptoms can include: feeling sick weight loss loss of appetite yellowing of the whites of the eyes or skin ( jaundice ) swelling in the ankles and tummy confusion or drowsiness vomiting blood or passing blood in your stools This means ARLD is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage. If you regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your GP so they can check if your liver is damaged. Alcohol and the liver The liver is one of the most complex organs in the body. Its functions include: filtering toxins from the blood aiding digestion of food regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels helping fight infection and disease The liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die. The liver can develop new cells, but prolonged alcohol misuse (drinking too much) over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can result in serious and permanent damage to your liver. ARLD is common in the UK. The number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades as a result of increasing levels of alcohol misuse. Read more about the causes of ARLD Stages of ARLD There are 3 main stages of ARLD, although there's often an overlap between each stage. These stages are explained here. Alcoholic fatty liver disease Drinking a large amount of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. This is called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD. Fatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it's an important warning sign that you're drinking at a harmful level. Fatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for some time (months or years), your liver should return to normal. Alcoholic hepatitis Alcoholic hepatitis, which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis , is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol. Less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking). The liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently. Severe alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious and life-threatening illness. Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage. Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is a stage of ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred. Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms. It's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy. Treating alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. This reduces the risk of further damage to your liver and gives it the best chance of recovering. If a person is dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. But support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol addiction support services . A liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and does not improve when you stop drinking alcohol. You'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you have developed complications of cirrhosis despite having stopped drinking. All liver transplant units require people with ARLD to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of their life. Complications Death rates linked to ARLD have risen considerably over the last few decades. Alcohol misuse is now one of the most common causes of death in the UK, along with smoking and high blood pressure . Life-threatening complications of ARLD include: internal (variceal) bleeding build-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy) fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure liver cancer increased vulnerability to infection Read more about the complications of ARLD Preventing alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) The most effective way to prevent ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the recommended limits: men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over 3 days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week if you want to cut down, try to have several drink-free days each week A unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal-strength lager or a pub measure (25ml) of spirits. Even if you have been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short-term and long-term benefits for your liver and overall health. See our alcohol advice pages for more information and support. Video: Liver disease In this video, consultant hepatologist Mark Wright explains liver disease and how not drinking alcohol can help.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), sometimes known as Hughes syndrome, is a disorder of the immune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots. This means people with APS are at greater risk of developing conditions such as: DVT (deep vein thrombosis , a blood clot that usually develops in the leg arterial thrombosis (a clot in an artery), which can cause a stroke or heart attack blood clots in the brain, leading to problems with balance, mobility, vision, speech and memory Pregnant women with APS also have an increased risk of having a miscarriage , although the exact reasons for this are uncertain. APS doesn't always cause noticeable problems. Some people have general symptoms that can be similar to those of multiple sclerosis (a common condition affecting the central nervous system), such as tiredness or numbness and tingling in different parts of the body. Find out more about signs and symptoms of APS What causes antiphospholipid syndrome? APS is an autoimmune condition. This means the immune system, which usually protects the body from infection and illness, attacks healthy tissue by mistake. In APS, the immune system produces abnormal antibodies called antiphospholipid antibodies. These target proteins attached to fat molecules (phospholipids), which makes the blood more likely to clot. It's not known what causes the immune system to produce abnormal antibodies. As with other autoimmune conditions, genetic, hormonal and environmental factors are thought to play a part. Find out more about the causes of APS Who's affected APS can affect people of all ages, including children and babies. But most people are diagnosed with APS between 20 and 50 years of age, and it affects 3 to 5 times as many women as men. It's not clear how many people in the UK have the condition. Diagnosing APS Diagnosing APS can sometimes be difficult, as some of the symptoms are similar to multiple sclerosis. This means blood tests to identify the antibodies responsible for APS are essential in diagnosing the condition. Find out more about diagnosing APS How antiphospholipid syndrome is treated Although there's no cure for APS, the risk of developing blood clots can be greatly reduced if it's correctly diagnosed. An anticoagulant medicine , such as warfarin , or an antiplatelet, such as low-dose aspirin , is usually prescribed. These reduce the likelihood of unnecessary blood clots forming, but still allow clots to form when you cut yourself. Treatment with these medications can also improve a pregnant woman's chance of having a successful pregnancy. With treatment, it's estimated there's about an 80% chance of having a successful pregnancy. Most people respond well to treatment and can lead normal, healthy lives. But a small number of people with APS continue to experience blood clots despite extensive treatment. Find out more about treating APS Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome In very rare cases, blood clots can suddenly form throughout the body, resulting in multiple organ failure. This is known as catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). CAPS requires immediate emergency treatment in hospital with high-dose anticoagulants . Read more about the complications of APS Further information APS Support UK is a UK-based charity for people living with antiphospholipid syndrome.
